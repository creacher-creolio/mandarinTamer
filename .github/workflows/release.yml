      # This links the workflow to your PyPI project page

      # Allows GitHub to generate a secure token for PyPI authentication
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # This step checks out your repository code into the GitHub Actions runner.
        # Without this, the runner wouldn't have access to your project files.

          python-version: "3.11"

          # We need Python to build and publish your package.

          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install build twine
        # This step:
        # 1. Upgrades pip to latest version to avoid any compatibility issues
        # 2. Installs 'build' (creates wheel and sdist packages)
        # 3. Installs 'twine' (tool for interacting with PyPI)

      - name: Build package
        run: python -m build
        # This creates two distribution formats:
        # 1. A wheel file (.whl) - A built package format
        # 2. A source distribution (.tar.gz) - Raw source code package
        # Both are needed for maximum compatibility with different systems

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        # This step publishes your built packages to PyPI
        # It uses GitHub's OIDC token for trusted publishing
        # No API token needed because you've set up trusted publishing
